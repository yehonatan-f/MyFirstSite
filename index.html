<h2 class="content1";>About Me</h2>

<h3 class="content2";>My name is Jonathan Fadida. I was born and raised in Rishon Lezion, and I now live in Jerusalem. Iâ€™m a professional social worker, leading rehabilitation
 processes and facilitating group sessions. Currently, I work at a hostel for homeless people, helping individuals find their path to recovery.
In addition to my work, I practice meditation, which helps me find inner peace and strengthen my concentration. I also enjoy solving challenging problems, especially in chess games. </h3>
